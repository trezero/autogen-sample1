from bravado.client import SwaggerClient

# Instantiate Swagger client with the Iconik API URL
client = SwaggerClient.from_url('https://api.iconik.io/v1/swagger.json')

# Now you can interact with the client to access the different API functionalities.
# For example, to list all assets:
assets = client.assets.get_all().result().items
print("All assets:", assets)

# These can now be used to build your media management system and ad-placement system.
# More functionalities can be added depending upon the services provided by the 'Iconik API'.
